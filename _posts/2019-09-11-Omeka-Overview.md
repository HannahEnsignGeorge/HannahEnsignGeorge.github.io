# What can you do with Omeka? #

Omeka is a host site you can use to publish a digital essay, share primary source collections, and collaborate with other scholars. Omeka exhibits can feature specific items from your digital collections, and collections can be created either independently or as a group.

# Plan Your Omeka Exhibit #

* Know the digital images and text you will be working with. Take the time to think about what metadata you wil use to describe those images. How are the images connected? Is there a narrative they share in common? 
* Additionally, think about who your audience is. What will the people who come to your Omeka site use it for? Is it a scholarly site? Does it highlight a local community concern? 
* These and other questions are important to keep in mind as you begin building your Omeka collection and creating exhibits. At the core lies the question of Purpose.

# Overview: Creating your Omeka Exhibit #

* Sign up for an account- when picking your domain name, pick one that reflects the topic of your research. This will make it easier for others interested in the same topic to find you on the web.
* Omeka offers a variety of free and paid plans to choose from. Pick one that works best for you, keeping in mind the features of each plan will either limit or greatly extend the power of your Omeka site.
* Choose and configure a design theme. Take some time to think about what the goal of your exhibit is and how you want visitors to interact with the materials presented. What Dublin Core fields will you include? How will you design the navigation? What information will be shown at different stages of navigation?
* Upload the photos and digitized documents you are going to use in your exhibit. These will create the website's "archive" and you will draw upon them to create your exhibit.
* Install the necessary plugins. Omeka does not automatically come with all of the plugins you will need to ensure your documents and images display correctly. Install plugins like DocsViewer to make sure PDF documents in your collection display correctly. Unfortunately not all plugins will be available with the free version of Omeka, meaining you might have to come up with work-arounds.
* Use Item Tags to create connections among sources. Users will be able to search your exhibit using these tags, engaging in the themes of your work. 
* Turn your Omeka exhibit into a collaborative space through inviting colleagues to become administrative users. This feature gives multiple people the ability to build and manage the site together.
