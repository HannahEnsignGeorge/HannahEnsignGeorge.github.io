# What can you do with Omeka? #

Omeka is a host site you can use to publish a digital essay, share primary source collections, and collaborate with other scholars. Omeka exhibits can feature specific items from your digital collections, and collections can be created either independently or as a group.

# Plan Your Omeka Exhibit #

* Know the digital images and text you will be working with. Take the time to think about what metadata you wil use to describe those images. How are the images connected? Is there a narrative they share in common? 
* Additionally, think about who your audience is. What will the people who come to your Omeka site use it for? Is it a scholarly site? Does it highlight a local community concern? 
* These and other questions are important to keep in mind as you begin building your Omeka collection and creating exhibits. At the core lies the question of Purpose.
