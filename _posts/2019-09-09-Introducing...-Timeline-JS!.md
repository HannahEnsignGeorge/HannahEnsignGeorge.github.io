1. Timeline JS is an open-source tool that allows anyone to create content-rich timelines. Present information to users in an interactive and compelling way. Timelines can be about any event you choose, but try to stick with events that have a strong chrological narrative. Events that skip forwards and then backwards in time are no good.
2. Media forms you can use include videos from Youtube or Vimeo, Wikipedia articles, tweets, and audio files from Soundcloud.
3. Customize your Timeline, with background colors and images. Use simple html formatting tags to change font size and color.
