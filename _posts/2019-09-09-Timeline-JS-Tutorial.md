## A Little Introduction to Timeline JS ##

1. Timeline JS is an open-source tool that allows anyone to create content-rcih timelines. Do more than present content, give it to users in an interactive and compelling way. Timelines can be about any event you choose, but they generally are most effective representing events fairly close together.
    1. For example: Timeline JS is great for representing an event of 5-10 years in length, like WWI or WWII. It can be used for longer time periods with events spread out over the period, but it's not as effective. 
2. Media forms you can use in your Timeline include Youtube, Vimeo, Wikipedia articles, tweets, audio files from Soundcloud, and more.
3. Customize your Timeline, with background colors and images. Use simple html formatting tags to change font size and color.

### A Basic Step-by-Step Guide to Create Your Timeline: Adapted from [Timeline JS at knight lab](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make) ###

1. **Getting Started:** Log into your Google account to download spreadsheet template and save on Google Drive [Timeline JS Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-BYrNCEAcSwn8Rr91uiYwee7VD-pK4x38auquRepm0/edit#gid=0)
    1. edit the timeline template to include the dates, text, links, and media specific to your project.
    2. You will fill you data into horizontal rows provided in the template. Delete the example data KnightLabs has in the template and then add your own.
    3. [Here is a link to my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G_DhfiS3g_mIs-lPvuATjqSIDCgRX5gSK9W4pY1SeA0/edit#gid=0)
    
2. **Publish to the Web**

### Important Notes on Timeline JS: Tricks & Hints ###

  * When importing in Timeline, make sure the URL you use takes you straight to the image. A URL to a wikipedia page where the image is will NOT work in Timeline. On Wikimedia, there should be a button that says "Use this file on the web" which gives you the URL you're looking for. Or, right click on an image and select "Open in a new tab" which should give you a usable URL too.
  * When working with eras, make sure your eras have starting and end dates. Similarly, if you give the exact hour an event started, it needs to have an ending hour as well. 

### HTML In-line Formatting ###

  * Want to change the color of your text in your Timeline? Use HTML color codes, [sourced here](https://html-color-codes.info/)
