# How to Create an Exhbit On Omeka #

 1. Select 'Add Exhbit' from the menu on the left side of your page. You'll want to make sure you have installed the Exhibit Builder plugin, which will help you create a content-rich, professional looking exhibit. Exhibit Builder can be accessed from the Plugins tab.

 2. Fill out Exhibit Metadata, including elements like the Title of your exhibit, the Slug (abbreviated name of website which appears in URL), and a Description of your exhibit.
 
 3. Scroll down the Exhibit Metadata page, to the where the Cover Image and Pages metadata section are. This is where you will add pages of items to your exhibit.

 4. When you add a page you give it a title, slug, and content of its own. Content includes items from your Omeka collection and whatever text you want to directly accompany those items.
