# I have this Omeka site, now what? #

You've signed up for your Omeka site and chosen the version of Omeka you want to use. (I'll be using the free version for the purpose of this example.) Now you might be thinking, "What the heck do I do next? I'm supposed to be able to create these awesome digital exhibits?"

Before you can become a world-class digital exhibit maker on Omeka, you need to add some items to your Omeka site. Copyright is a concern when downloading images off the internet, see your instructor for specific guidelines relating to your project. My favorite resource for public domain images is the [New York Public Library's Digital Collections](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/).

## Adding An Item: ##

1. Pick an image

2. Fill out the Dublin Core metadata about the item

   </p>
   
3. Fill out the Item Type Metadata: pick type of media (still image, etc.), Omeka will generate type-specific metadata

   </p>
   
4. Upload item files, more than one file can be uploaded to a single item

   </p>
   
 5. Add item tags to relate this item to other items in your collection: helpful tool for users searching your collections and exhibits
