    <h1>Simple Pages</h1>
      <p>What is Simple Pages, you ask? Simple Pages is a plug-in available with any version of Omeka. It allows you to easily create pages of narrative text or other information to accompany your Omeka site. No complicated coding necessary, most of the formatting work is done for you and all you need to focus on is presenting your information.</p>
      <p>Possible pages you might want to add to your Omeka site include an 'About' page to give additional details about your project. A 'Contributors' page is a good idea if you're using Omeka as a group. Want to give historical context for your Omeka collection? Create a 'History' page to tell more of the story.</p>
