    <h1>Simple Pages</h1>
      <p>What is Simple Pages, you ask? Simple Pages is a plug-in available with any version of Omeka. It allows you to easily create pages of narrative text or other information to accompany your Omeka site. No complicated coding necessary, most of the formatting work is done for you and all you need to focus on is presenting your information.</p>

     <p>Possible pages you might want to add to your Omeka site include an 'About' page to give additional details about your project. A 'Contributors' page is a good idea if you're using Omeka as a group. Want to give historical context for your Omeka collection? Create a 'History' page to tell more of the story.</p>

    <p>Things You Need to Include:
      <ul>
        <li>Elements of a Good Simple Page</li>
        <li>A Slug, which is information coming after a slash in a URL. Example: otutorial.omeka.net/whoweare, the slug is 'whoweare'</li>
        <li>Some text and maybe images, using the text box available. You can choose between using the HTML editor, or just typing directly in the textbox.</li>
        <li>Decide where you want to put your page. Should it be directly under the Main Page, or is it a childpage of a different Simple Page you've already made? For example, in my tutorial Omeka site I have a main page entitled Architecture in America, which has a child page, The U.S. Capitol.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>When adding text to your page there are a few options for inserting images, links, or videos. The easiest way to insert an image is to add one from your Omeka collection. The text field supports shortcodes, which are easy ways to insert images, format simple pages, and more.</p>
