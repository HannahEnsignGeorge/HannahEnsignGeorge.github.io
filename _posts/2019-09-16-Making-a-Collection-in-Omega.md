# How to Create am Omeka Collection #

Creating a collection in Omeka is very easy. Click on the Collections tab on the left side menu. The next page is 'Browse Collections' which has a green button that says 'Add a collection'. You'll then fill out the metadata for the collection. This metadata gives context for the collection and provides users with background information for the items your collection presents.
