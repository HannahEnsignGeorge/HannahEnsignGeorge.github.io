  <h2>Plan Your Omeka Exhibit</h2>
    <p >
      <ul>
        <li>Know the digital images and text you will be working with. Take time to think about how you will describe those images, i.e. what metadata you will use.</li>
        <li>How are the images commected? Is there a narrative they share?</li>
        <li>Think about the audience for your Omeka site.</li>
        <li>Why will people visit your Omeka site? Is it for scholarly concerns? Does it highlight a local community concern?</li>
        <li>Core Question: What is the Purpose of your Omeka site?</li>
