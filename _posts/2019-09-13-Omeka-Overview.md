  <h1 style="font-family:Arial;font-size:30px;strong;">What can you do with Omeka?</h1>
    <p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:20px;">Omeka is a site you can use to publish a digital essay, share primary source collections, and collaborate with other scholars. Omeka exhibits can feature items from your digital collections, and collections can be created either independently or as a group. Anyone from a student to an institution can use Omeka for their digital projects.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family:Arial;font-size:30px;strong;">Plan Your Omeka Exhibit</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Arial;font-size:20px;">
      <ul>
        <li>Know the digital images and text you will be working with. Take time to think about how you will describe those images, i.e. what metadata you will use.</li>
        <li>How are the images commected? Is there a narrative they share?</li>
        <li>Think about the audience for your Omeka site.</li>
        <li>Why will people visit your Omeka site? Is it for scholarly concerns? Does it highlight a local community concern?</li>
        <li>Core Question: What is the Purpose of your Omeka site?</li>
      </ul>
