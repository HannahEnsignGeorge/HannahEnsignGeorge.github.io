<h1>How to Create an Exhibit On Omeka</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Select 'Add Exhibit' from the menu on the left side of your page. You'll want to make sure you have installed the Exhibit Builder plugin, which will help you create a content-rich, professional looking exhibit. Exhibit Builder can be accessed from the Plugins tab.</li>

  <li>Fill out Exhibit Metadata, including elements like the Title of your exhibit, the Slug (abbreviated name of website which appears in URL), and a Description of your exhibit.</li>
  
  <li>Scroll down the Exhibit Metadata page, to the where the Cover Image and Pages metadata section are. This is where you will add pages of items to your exhibit.</li>

  <li>When you add a page you give it a title, slug, and content of its own. Content includes items from your Omeka collection and whatever text you want to directly accompany those items.</li>
