  <h1>Make Your Omeka Theme Work for YOU:</h1>
  <p>Well, with some limitations. The free Omeka only has two themes to choose from, but within those themes there are options to customize your Omeka site!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Choose things like a logo file, a header image, or footer text. I go into detail on adding logo files and header images below. A footer text is a good place to put copyright or project information. Go to the 'Appearance' tab, 'Configure Theme', and 'Themes'.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Decide what items your Homepage should include, like Featured Items & Collections. Scroll down the 'Themes' page to make your customizations. Items featured on the homepage of your collection should be representative and draw your viewers in. </p>
