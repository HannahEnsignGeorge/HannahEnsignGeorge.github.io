    <h1>Simple Pages</h1>
      <p>What is Simple Pages, you ask? Simple Pages is a plug-in available with any version of Omeka. It allows you to easily create pages of narrative text or other information to accompany your Omeka site. No complicated coding necessary, most of the formatting work is done for you and all you need to focus on is presenting your information.</p>

    </p>
     <p>Possible pages you might want to add to your Omeka site include an 'About' page to give additional details about your project. A 'Contributors' page is a good idea if you're using Omeka as a group. Want to give historical context for your Omeka collection? Create a 'History' page to tell more of the story.</p>

    <h1>Things You Need to Include</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A Slug, which is information coming after a slash in a URL. Example: otutorial.omeka.net/whoweare, the slug is 'whoweare'</li>
        <li>Some text and maybe images, using the text box available. You can choose between using the HTML editor, or just typing directly in the textbox.</li>
         <p align="center">

         </p>
        <li>Decide where you want to put your page. Should it be directly under the Main Page, or is it a childpage of a different Simple Page you've already made? For example, in my tutorial Omeka site I have a main page entitled Architecture in America, which has a child page, The U.S. Capitol.</li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Using Omeka Shortcodes</h1>
    <p>Shortcodes is an Omeka-supported syntax that allows you to add references to exhibit content when creating a Simple Page. While you can add images or video through HTML embed codes, utilizing the Omeka shortcodes can often make your life easier. The easiest way to insert an image is to add one from your Omeka collection.</p>
    <h3>Useful Shortcodes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>General shortcode syntax: [shortcode key=value]</li>
      <li>To insert files from you Omeka collection: [file id=value(item number)]</li>
      <li>Embed multiple, selected items: [items ids=5, 9, 16]</li>
      <li>To return one or multiple collections: [collections num=3]</li>
      <li>Embed items with a particular tag(s): [items tags=Hotels,Stereographs]</li>
    </ul>
